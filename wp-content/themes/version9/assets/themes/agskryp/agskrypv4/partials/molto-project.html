    <p>moltoDESTROYED is a silly web comic created by Molto D. Stroyed.
    <br /><br />
    The process in building moltoDESTROYED started with designing an interface that would transition well 
    from mobile devices, to desktop computers.  Using the Bootstrap framework, I was 
    able to create a simple and narrow design to accompany the comic strips.  Large buttons are used for 
    comic and site navigation.
    <br /><br />
    The next issue was to build a site foundation that would be simple and easy to update with each new comic.
    Every comic strip needs to have their own personalized link, and the navigation between each comic 
    needs to be updated and adjusted accordingly.  The Angular.js framework made all of these necessities 
    possible by wiring everything to a single Javascript file, and the UI Router extension gave each comic its 
    own link.
