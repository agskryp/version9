    <p>agskryp.com is the homepage for front-end web developer Andrew Skrypnyk.
    <br /><br />
    The site was designed with three main sections using the foundation framework.  A home section, which 
    introduces the user to what the website is about.  A project section, cataloging and describing the various 
    works that had been accomplished, and an information section, giving the user additional knowledge of who he 
    is and what he knows.
    <br /><br />
    To add various flair to the website, the body background, as well as the title text colour is animated, 
    clicking on the site navigation buttons will smoothly scroll to its intended location, and projects images 
    have a bubble effect via Bounce.js when a cursor hovers over them.
    <br /><br />
    You can view the site by visiting <a href="http://agskryp.com" target="_blank">agskryp.com</a>
